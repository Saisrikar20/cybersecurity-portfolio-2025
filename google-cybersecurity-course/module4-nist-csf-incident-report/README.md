# 🛡️ Module 4 – NIST CSF-Based Incident Response Report

This folder contains the **Incident Response Report** for **Module 4** of the [Google Cybersecurity Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-cybersecurity).

## 📘 Scenario Summary

In this simulated scenario, a multimedia company experienced a **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)** attack via a flood of ICMP packets. The attack exploited an unconfigured firewall and caused a 2-hour outage in internal network services.

As a **Cybersecurity Analyst**, I was responsible for documenting and responding to this incident using the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**.

## 🔐 NIST CSF Applied

The response was structured around the **five functions** of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework:

- 🔍 **Identify** – Auditing systems, recognizing risk exposure (unconfigured firewall)
- 🛡️ **Protect** – Implementing ICMP filtering, IP verification, staff policies
- 📡 **Detect** – Using IDS/IPS and network monitoring to identify future DDoS attempts
- 🚨 **Respond** – Steps to contain, communicate, and neutralize the threat
- ♻️ **Recover** – Restoring services, performing post-incident analysis and system hardening
