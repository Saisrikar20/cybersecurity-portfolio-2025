# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Portfolio 2025

Welcome to my **Cybersecurity Portfolio 2025** — a collection of hands-on projects, reports, and simulations developed through the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate**, **IBM Ethical Hacking with Open Source Tools**, and **Hack The Box**.  

This portfolio represents my mission to grow into an elite cybersecurity professional by applying **blue team defense**, **ethical hacking**, and **offensive security skills** in real-world-like environments.  

---

## 🔥 Objectives
- Apply cybersecurity concepts in **real-world scenarios**  
- Build a portfolio aligned with **NIST CSF**, **MITRE ATT&CK**, and **SOC operations**  
- Demonstrate expertise with **security tools and frameworks**  
- Document findings professionally for use in **job applications** and **interviews**
